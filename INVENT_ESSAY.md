# Rate Cat Photo Lighting

## Purpose

Every photograph of a cat is, at its heart, an attempt to show someone a cat. Not a concept, not a mood — a cat. A specific animal with a particular face, a coat of unique texture, a body that sits or stretches or curls in its own characteristic way. The lighting in that photograph has one fundamental job: to let the viewer see the cat. When it does that job well, the light disappears. You don't think about it. You just see the cat — its whiskers catching a faint edge of brightness, the subtle banding in its tabby fur, the shape of its ears against the background. When the lighting fails, the cat vanishes in some way. It is swallowed by shadow, bleached by overexposure, or distorted by an unnatural cast that makes the image feel wrong before you can articulate why.

The purpose of rate-cat-photo-lighting is to measure how well the light in a cat photograph fulfills this responsibility. It is not a general lighting aesthetics score. It does not care whether the light creates a dramatic atmosphere or follows classical compositional rules. It asks one question: does this light reveal the cat? The function takes a single photograph of a cat as input and returns a scalar score representing how effectively the lighting makes the cat visible and appreciable as a physical subject. This score is useful anywhere cat photographs are collected, curated, or evaluated at scale — from pet adoption platforms that need to show animals clearly to potential adopters, to photo communities that want to surface the most viewable images, to automated pipelines that filter or rank cat photographs by quality. In each case, the underlying need is the same. Someone is going to look at this photo to see a cat, and the lighting either helps them do that or gets in the way.

## Input

The input is a photograph containing a cat. It may come from any source — a phone camera in a dim apartment, a DSLR in a sunlit garden, a hasty snapshot in a veterinary clinic. The photographs are not expected to be professional. Most will be casual, taken by people who simply wanted to capture their cat in a moment. The lighting conditions will vary enormously: morning sun through a window, the flat glow of an overcast afternoon, the warm amber of a bedside lamp, the cool overhead wash of fluorescent office light. None of these conditions are inherently good or bad. What matters is whether, given the light that was present, the cat can be clearly seen.

This is an important distinction. The function does not compare the photograph against an ideal studio setup. It does not require softboxes, reflectors, or golden-hour backlighting. A cat sitting on a kitchen counter under ordinary ceiling lights, fully visible with readable fur texture and a clear face, represents good lighting for the purposes of this function. A cat photographed during a dramatic sunset that reduces the animal to a dark silhouette against a blazing sky does not — no matter how beautiful the sky looks. The input is always evaluated from the perspective of the cat as subject. The light is in service to the cat, not the other way around.

## Three Qualities

### 1. Subject Clarity

The most essential quality is whether the light allows the viewer to clearly perceive the cat's physical presence. This means the cat's face, fur, and body form are visible without effort. The viewer should be able to see the cat's eyes, the shape of its nose and mouth, the lay of its coat, and the contour of its body. Fur texture is particularly important — it is one of the defining visual characteristics of a cat, and lighting that renders fur as a flat, indistinct mass has failed to capture what makes the subject what it is. Subject clarity does not require every hair to be individually resolved. It requires that the light provide enough information for the viewer to perceive the cat as a three-dimensional, textured, living animal rather than a vague shape. A cat photographed in soft, even window light that gently models the planes of its face and the depth of its fur scores well on this quality. A cat lost in a dark corner, where the viewer must squint and guess at the animal's features, does not.

### 2. Tonal Balance

Good functional lighting maintains a healthy relationship between light and shadow across the cat's body. Some contrast is natural and even helpful — gentle shadows give the cat dimension, revealing the curve of a haunch or the hollow beneath a chin. But the extremes are where lighting fails. Harsh overexposure blows out regions of the cat into featureless white, erasing detail as surely as if someone had taken an eraser to the photograph. A white cat on a sunlit windowsill can become a shapeless bright mass, its features obliterated. On the other end, deep underexposure drops the cat into shadow so dense that the animal becomes a silhouette — recognizable as cat-shaped, perhaps, but stripped of every detail that makes it a specific, individual cat. Tonal balance asks whether the range of brightness across the cat preserves detail at both ends. The brightest parts of the cat should still carry texture. The darkest parts should still be readable. The light does not need to be perfectly even, but it must not destroy information at the extremes.

### 3. Lighting Integrity

The third quality addresses whether the light presents the cat honestly, without distracting artifacts that interfere with the viewer's perception. This includes extreme glare — hard specular reflections that create blown-out hot spots on the cat's fur or eyes, pulling attention away from the animal and toward the light source itself. It includes unnatural color casts that shift the cat's appearance in ways that feel wrong: a sickly green from certain fluorescent lights, a harsh blue from an uncorrected flash, an overwhelming orange that makes the cat look like it belongs to a different world. It also includes any lighting artifact that makes the viewer notice the light rather than the cat. The standard here is not color perfection or the absence of any warmth or coolness in the light. Natural color temperatures are fine — the golden warmth of late afternoon, the cool blue of shade, the soft neutrality of cloud cover. What matters is whether the color and quality of the light feel coherent and unobtrusive, allowing the cat to look like itself rather than like a subject distorted by the conditions under which it was photographed. Light with integrity is light you can trust to show you what the cat actually looks like.
