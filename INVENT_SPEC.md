Evaluate how effectively the lighting in the cat photograph reveals the cat as a subject. Score how well the light allows the viewer to clearly see the cat's face, fur texture, and body form without straining. Penalize harsh overexposure that washes out detail into featureless white, deep shadows that swallow the cat into darkness and reduce it to a silhouette, and distracting lighting artifacts like extreme glare or unnatural color casts. The standard is functional lighting — light that works for the cat by making it visible and appreciable. Studio-perfect lighting is not required; soft window light, overcast sky glow, or warm ambient room light all qualify as effective if they reveal the cat clearly. What matters is whether the light serves the cat — illuminating its physical presence with enough clarity for the viewer to see and appreciate it — or fails it by hiding, distorting, or overwhelming its features.
