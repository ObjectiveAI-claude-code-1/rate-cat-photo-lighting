1. Evaluate subject clarity by assessing whether the lighting allows the viewer to clearly perceive the cat's physical presence. Determine if the cat's face, eyes, fur texture, and body form are visible without effort. The light should provide enough information for the cat to read as a three-dimensional, textured, living animal rather than a vague or indistinct shape. Score highly when soft, functional light gently models the planes of the cat's face and reveals the depth and lay of its coat. Score poorly when the cat is lost in darkness, buried in murk, or otherwise rendered so dimly that the viewer must strain to make out its features.

2. Evaluate tonal balance by assessing whether the range of brightness across the cat preserves detail at both the light and dark extremes. Determine if the brightest areas of the cat still carry visible texture rather than being blown out into featureless white, and if the darkest areas remain readable rather than collapsing into impenetrable shadow. Some contrast is natural and welcome — gentle shadows give the cat dimension. The failure is at the extremes: harsh overexposure that erases detail into blank whiteness, or deep underexposure that reduces the cat to a silhouette stripped of individuality. Score highly when the light maintains a healthy tonal range that preserves information across the entire cat. Score poorly when either extreme destroys the detail that makes the cat visible and specific.

3. Evaluate lighting integrity by assessing whether the light presents the cat honestly and without distracting artifacts. Determine if extreme glare, hard specular hot spots, or unnatural color casts interfere with the viewer's perception of the cat. The standard is not the absence of any color temperature — the golden warmth of late afternoon, the cool blue of shade, and the soft neutrality of overcast sky are all acceptable. The failure is when the color or quality of the light feels wrong, incoherent, or obtrusive: a sickly green fluorescent cast, a harsh blue flash, an overwhelming unnatural tint, or bright glare spots that pull attention away from the cat and toward the light itself. Score highly when the light feels trustworthy and invisible, letting the cat look like itself. Score poorly when lighting artifacts distort the cat's appearance or distract from it.
